# DFZ Integration with Concurrent Tasks

This document details the implementation and usage of concurrent task execution with the DFZ integration in CTM-AbsoluteZero.

## Overview

The DFZ integration module has been extended to support concurrent task execution, allowing multiple tasks to be processed simultaneously. This can significantly improve throughput and performance when working with tasks that are independent of each other, such as quantum simulations, maze solving, or image classification tasks.

## Architecture

The concurrent task execution system is built on top of the existing DFZ integration module and utilizes the following components:

1. **ConcurrentTaskManager**: Handles the scheduling and execution of concurrent tasks using thread or process pools.
2. **ConcurrentCTMAbsoluteZeroPlugin**: Extends the base CTM-AbsoluteZero plugin with concurrent task execution capabilities.
3. **ConcurrentDFZAdapter**: Extends the base DFZ adapter to support concurrent task operations.

## Features

- **Thread and Process-based concurrency**: Choose between thread-based parallelism (suitable for I/O-bound tasks) or process-based parallelism (suitable for CPU-bound tasks).
- **Dynamic task scheduling**: Tasks are automatically scheduled across available workers for optimal resource utilization.
- **Task status tracking**: Monitor the status of tasks as they progress through execution.
- **Performance metrics**: Detailed metrics to analyze concurrent execution performance, including speedup factors, success rates, and resource utilization.
- **Scaling analysis**: Tools to analyze how performance scales with different numbers of concurrent workers.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

To use the concurrent task execution capability:

```python
import asyncio
from src.integration.dfz_concurrent import ConcurrentDFZAdapter

async def main():
    # Create a concurrent DFZ adapter with 4 workers
    adapter = ConcurrentDFZAdapter(
        config={"config_path": "configs/default.yaml"},
        max_workers=4
    )
    
    # Initialize the adapter
    await adapter.initialize()
    
    # Define a batch of tasks
    tasks = [
        {
            "id": "task_1",
            "domain": "quantum",
            "description": "Quantum task 1",
            "parameters": {
                "algorithm": "vqe",
                "num_qubits": 5,
                "noise_level": 0.01,
                "circuit_depth": 4
            }
        },
        {
            "id": "task_2",
            "domain": "quantum",
            "description": "Quantum task 2",
            "parameters": {
                "algorithm": "grover",
                "num_qubits": 6,
                "noise_level": 0.02,
                "circuit_depth": 3
            }
        }
    ]
    
    # Execute tasks concurrently
    result = await adapter.execute_tasks_batch(tasks, wait=True)
    
    # Process results
    for task_id, task_result in result["results"].items():
        print(f"Task {task_id}: {task_result['status']}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Running Performance Tests

The framework includes a comprehensive testing script to measure and compare sequential vs. concurrent execution performance:

```bash
# Run a basic benchmark on quantum tasks with 4 workers
python examples/test_dfz_concurrency.py --domain quantum --count 20 --workers 4

# Run a scaling test to measure performance with different worker counts
python examples/test_dfz_concurrency.py --domain quantum --count 20 --scaling-test --max-workers 1,2,4,8,16

# Use process-based parallelism instead of threads
python examples/test_dfz_concurrency.py --domain quantum --count 20 --workers 4 --use-processes
```

## Performance Considerations

### When to Use Concurrent Execution

Concurrent execution is most beneficial when:

1. Tasks are independent of each other
2. Task execution involves waiting periods (I/O, network, etc.)
3. Multiple hardware resources are available (CPU cores, GPUs)
4. The overhead of task synchronization is small compared to task execution time

### Threads vs. Processes

- **Threads**: Suitable for I/O-bound tasks, shared memory model, lower overhead
- **Processes**: Suitable for CPU-bound tasks, isolated memory model, higher overhead

### Optimal Worker Count

The optimal number of workers depends on:

1. The nature of the tasks (CPU-bound vs. I/O-bound)
2. Available system resources (CPU cores, memory)
3. Task characteristics (execution time, resource usage)

For CPU-bound tasks, a good starting point is to use a worker count equal to the number of available CPU cores. For I/O-bound tasks, you might benefit from using more workers than CPU cores.

## Implementation Details

### Task Lifecycle

1. **Submission**: Tasks are submitted to the task manager
2. **Scheduling**: Tasks are scheduled for execution on available workers
3. **Execution**: Workers execute the tasks
4. **Completion**: Results are collected and returned

### Task Status Tracking

Tasks can be in one of the following states:

- **Pending**: Task has been submitted but not yet started
- **Running**: Task is currently being executed
- **Completed**: Task has been successfully completed
- **Failed**: Task execution failed with an error

### Performance Metrics

The following metrics are tracked:

- **Total Duration**: Total time to execute all tasks
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of tasks that completed successfully
- **Average Duration**: Average time per task
- **Concurrency Level**: Average and maximum number of concurrent tasks

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **High Failure Rate**: 
   - Check task parameters for validity
   - Ensure sufficient system resources for concurrent execution
   - Reduce the number of workers

2. **Low Speedup**: 
   - Tasks may be too short to benefit from concurrent execution
   - Tasks may be competing for the same resources
   - The workload may have a high sequential component

3. **Deadlocks or Hanging**: 
   - Check for resource contention
   - Ensure tasks don't depend on each other
   - Try using threads instead of processes or vice versa

### Debugging

To enable detailed logging:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Task Prioritization**: Support for task priorities and preemption
2. **Resource-aware Scheduling**: Schedule tasks based on resource requirements and availability
3. **Fault Tolerance**: Automatic retries and failure handling
4. **Dynamic Worker Pooling**: Adjust the worker pool size based on system load and task characteristics

## Conclusion

The DFZ concurrent task execution system provides a powerful way to improve the performance and throughput of CTM-AbsoluteZero. By executing tasks concurrently, you can make more efficient use of available resources and reduce overall execution time for batches of independent tasks.
